<h2><a name="SEC1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<br>
EBView is a program to display dictionaries in the EPWING format. Notable
feature is :<br>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-lexicon retrieval</li>
  <li>Automatic search of words in the selection buffer</li>
  <li>Stemming</li>
  <li>Multimedia support</li>
</ul>
As it uses Japanese you must set the character locale (LC_CTYPE) to a suitable
value (ja_JP.EUC-JP).   For example, calling the program as follows "env
LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.EUC-JP /usr/bin/ebview".<br>
<h2><a name="SEC2"></a>2. Preparation</h2>
<h3>Getting Dictionaries</h3>
<br>
First, one or more dictionaries are necessary to use this software. Both
free and commercial dictionaries can be used.   You can use dictionaries
in the EPWING format, and sometimes in the EB, EBG, EBXA and EBXA-C formats.
There are some free dictionaries distributed on the internet.   For example,
there is a list of <a href="http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/edict/fpw/"> "Dictionaries
that work with FreePWING" here </a>.<br>
Once you have the dictionaries place them in some suitable directory.   If
you purchased dictionaries on CD-ROM then the manuals that come with them
should tell you how to copy them.   Normally,  you can just copy the whole
CDROM as is.   Make sure you DO NOT VIOLATE the copyright restrictions of
any dictionaries. 
<h3>Adding Dictionaries</h3>
<br>
  The first time you use the program, add one or more dictionaries using the
"Add/Remove Dictionary" entry from the "Settings" menu.  Follow the steps
bellow:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><b>1. Add a Dictionary Group</b><br>
  <br>
  You need to add dictionary group. Put the name in the "Group Name" box
and click the "Add" button.    "EtoJ" or "JtoE" will be fine.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to use "Selection Lookup" feature, you might want to add a
group named "selection".    If it exists, EBView will always use this group
on Selsction Lookup.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Identify Avaliable Dictionaries</b><br>
  <br>
  Then, identify dictionaries in hard disk. Enter the directory that contains
the dictionary information    (it should contain a file called <catalog>or
  <catalogs>).   Then press the "Search Disk" button and it will read the
catalog.   You can specify the depth of directories to recursively search
using the number next to the directory name.     "0" means search no subdirectories.<br>
  <br>
  <b>3. Choose Selected Dictionaries to add to the Dictionary Group</b><br>
  <br>
  Choose the dictionary or dictionaries to add to the dictionary group and
click the "Add" button.     You can change the name of the dictionary as
you desire.<br>
  <br>
  </catalogs></catalog></blockquote>
Now, you can start searching. All the information about setting is stored
in a file in a directory called .ebview in the user's home directory.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SEC3"></a>3. Searching</h2>
<br>
Here is a steps to search.<br>
<h3>The Dictionary Selection Toolbar</h3>
<br>
 The Dictionary Selection Toolbar allows you to choose a dictionary group,
 and then select which dictionaries will be used from within that group.
Only selected dictionaries will be searched.   If you want to stop searching
one or more dictionaries you can toggle them by pushing their buttons.  
If a dictionary cannot be found, then its button cannot be pushed.   In this
case, check whether the dictionary file still exists or if its CD-ROM has
been mounted.  You can change how many characters of the dictionary names
appear on the buttons using the Settings/Misc/Bytes in Dictionary Bar. <br>
<br>
<h3>The Search Toolbar</h3>
<br>
You can choose the search method either from the search menu or the toolbar.
Bellow is the meaning of each methods.<br>
<br>

<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>Entering Search Words</h3>
<br>
Then you should enter a keyword or space-separated keywords in the text box
and hit the enter key, or click the search icon. <br>
<br>
<h3>Search Result</h3>
<br>
A list of hits will be displayed in the box on the left of the result frame.
The detailed informaiton of the first result will be displayed on the right.
You can see more information about other entries by selecting them from the
hit list.   You can also move up and down the list using shortcut key. When
there are so manyu hits, only limited number of hits will be listed. You
can tune this number with [Settings]-&gt;[Misc]-&gt;"Maximum hits to display".
<br>
<br>
<h3>Jumping</h3>
<br>
Some words are highlighted in blue in the search results. These are hyperlinks
to other entries in the dictionary. Your cursor should change as it passes
over them, and if you click the left mouse button, you can jump to the hyperlinked
entry. Your search history is stored, so you can go back using the back button
and then forward again using the forward button.<br>
<br>
<h3>Selecting Content</h3>
<br>
  You can choose the index word using the mouse to mark a region (such as
by dragging the mouse accross a word or double clicking on it). Double clicking
will choose all characters of the same type around the cursor (where type
is hiragana/katakana or kanji). For example, in the text "このソフトウェアは..." (This
software-TOPIC) if you click on the "ウ" it will select "ソフトウェア" (software).
In the same way, for the text "辞書の追加と削除", clicking on "追" will select "追加".
<br>
  The selected text will be placed in the X-selection, so you can paste it
into other applications by clicking the middle button (assuming that "Selection
Lookup" is off). <br>
<br>
Clicking the right button gives a menu with three options:  + Search Selected
Word  + Copy to Clipboard (Ctrl-C)  + Display    - Menubar    - Dictionary
Selection Toolbar    - Statusbar If you choose "search selected word", EBview
will search for the selected word. If you choose "copy to clipboard" the
selected word will be copied to the clipboard. You can also do this by hitting
Ctrl-c (Holding down the control key and pressing "c"). Once a word is in
the clipboard, you can then paste it into other applications (for example
using Ctrl-v, or Ctrl-y in emacs. How to paste depends on the application).<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SEC4"></a>4. Selection Lookup</h2>
<br>
Selection lookup makes it possible to look up words automatically even from
other applications. For example, you can look up unknown words as you are
browsing.<br>
In general, in order not to get too many useless lookups, it is a good idea
to choose "exact match" as the search method, and not select too many dictionaries.
<br>
<br>
If a dictionary group named "selection" exists, EBView will use that group
regardless of the current group.<br>
<br>
In addition to getting results in the EBView result window, you can choose
to display them in a pop-up window. To do this you must select both "selection
lookup" and "pop-up display".<br>
Mouse operation on popup display:<br>
<blockquote>                 
  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="70%">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">Left Button</td>
        <td valign="top">Close popup window.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">Middle Button</td>
        <td valign="top">Back to previous hits.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">Right Button</td>
        <td valign="top">Go to next hits.</td>
      </tr>
                             
    </tbody>                 
  </table>
  <br>
</blockquote>
Clicking on hypertext links with the left button works normally,  clicking
anywhere else with the left button closes the pop-up window.<br>
You can't look up the same word twice using selection lookup. If you want
to look a word up again, you must first select something else,  and then
select the word you want to look up again.<br>
<br>
<h2>5. Stemming</h2>
<br>
When looking up inflected words, such as "dictionaries", we need to search
for the base form: "dictionary". The user can check each word and convert
them as necessary,but this is tedious and inconvenient for automatic lookup
of the X-selection. So, EBview automatically stems inflected words, so that
it can lookup the base form. We call this feature "stemming". You can let
EBView to only stem if the original form could not be found (this is the
default).<br>
EBview looks at the end of a word, and if it matches a set of patterns, converts
it to the base form. Therefore, if you turn stemming on, lookup takes more
time. You can turn stemming on or off, and customize the patterns used in
the Settings menu, Stemming sub-menu. Adding many patterns makes the lookup
very slow, so be careful. You can also change the order in which patterns
match by dragging and dropping patterns in the Stemming Setting box.<br>
Starting from version 0.1.6, EBView performs stemming for Japanese words.
For example, when you specify 「出られない」 as search word,「出る」 will hit. Algorithm
used in Japanese stemming is almost the same as that of English, there is
a slight difference. When normal stemming resulted in no hit, then EBView
will try searching with kanji characters in keyword. Yor cannot customize
Japanese stemming pattern for the present.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SEC6"></a>6. Playing Multimedia Data</h2>
<br>
EBView supports multimedia data such as sound and movie. References to such
data are shown green charancter.  Your cursor should change as it passes over
them,  and if you click the left mouse button, you can play sound or movie.<br>
<br>
EBView uses external program to play multimedia, so you need to specify programs
which are capable to play actual data. Open [Settings]-&gt;[External Program]
and enter the name of external program. For example, "playwave %f" for sound.
%f is mandatory.  Prior to lanuch external program, EBView will store multimedia
data to temporally file. %f will be replaced by temporally file internally.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SEC7"></a>7. Internet Search</h2>
<br>
EBView can launch external browser to perform searching by Internet Search
Engines. It is convenient when you cannot find desired information from your
local dctionary,  or you want to perform internet search on multiple search
engines.<br>
<br>
Choose "Internet Search" as search method. Search engines are listed in left
frame. Choose one of them, enter keywords, press enter key or start button.
Double click on search engine name will also start search. Right clicking
on search engine name will popup menus.  You can jump to Homepage from here.
You may need this when you want to specify detailed optional parameter.<br>
<br>
If nothing happens, please check command to launch browser.  [Settings]-&gt;[External
Program] has an entry. Example is "gnome-moz-remote %f". %f is mandatory and
will be replaced by URL.<br>
<br>
You can customize the list of search engine in [Settings]-&gt;[Search Engines].
Final URL will be the conjunction of "Pre string" and keyword and "Post string".
If you specify multiple words, each words will be concatenated with "Glue
string". Character code of keyword will be converted to specified code, as
some search engine requires specific character code. Please note that you
can only use search engine which uses "get" method rather than "post" method.
<br>
<br>
Some search engines such as "<a href="http://www.alc.co.jp/">英辞郎 on the Web</a>"
prohibits these kind of searching. They only permits access from its Homepage.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SEC8"></a>8. Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

You can assign keyboard shortcuts to some function, such as selecting dictionary
group. Multiple shortcuts will be assigned to a function. Here is a default
